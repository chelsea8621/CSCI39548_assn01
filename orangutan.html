            Orangutans are great apes native to the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia. Known for their distinctive red fur, orangutans are the largest arboreal mammal, spending most of their time in trees. They have long, powerful arms that allow them to move freely through trees. Orangutans are among the most intelligent primates, and they share approximately 96.4% of our genes.
